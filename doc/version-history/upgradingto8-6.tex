\index{upgrading!items to be aware of}
Upgrading from the 8.4 series of HTCondor to the 8.6 series
will bring new features introduced in the 8.5 series of HTCondor.
These new features include the following (note that this list contains
only the most significant changes; a full list of changes can be
found in the version history:~\ref{sec:History-8-5}):

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{q}-related changes:
  \begin{itemize}

  \item \Condor{q} now defaults to showing only the current user's jobs.
  \Ticket{5271}
  Similarly, \Condor{qedit} defaults to editing only jobs owned by the
  current user.  
  \Ticket{5889}
  (The previous behavior of both commands can be restored by setting
  \MacroNI{CONDOR\_Q\_ONLY\_MY\_JOBS} to \Expr{False} --
  see ~\ref{param:CondorQOnlyMyJobs}.)

  \item \Condor{q} now defaults to batch mode, which produces a single
  line of output summarizing a batch of jobs (see~\pageref{batches-of-jobs}).
  \Ticket{5708}
  (The previous behavior can be restored by setting
  \MacroNI{CONDOR\_Q\_DASH\_BATCH\_IS\_DEFAULT} to \Expr{False} --
  see ~\ref{param:CondorQDashBatchIsDefault}.)

  \item \Condor{q} (and \Condor{history} and \Condor{status}) can now
  read and write JSON, XML, and new ClassAd formats
  (see~\pageref{man-condor-q}, ~\pageref{man-condor-history},
  and ~\pageref{man-condor-status}).
  \Ticket{5688}
  \Ticket{5844}
  \Ticket{5820}

  \end{itemize}

\item Job submission-related changes:
  \begin{itemize}

   \item Added the ability for the \Condor{schedd} to transform
   job ClassAds upon job submission
   (see section~\ref{sec:Schedd-Config-Job-Transforms}).

   \item Added the ability to group jobs into batches, and assign
   names to the batches, using the new \Opt{-batch} arguments to
   \Condor{submit} and \Condor{submit\_dag}.

   \item Added support in the submit language for retrying jobs
   if they fail (see~\pageref{condor-submit-max-retries}).

  \end{itemize}

\item \Condor{dagman}-related changes:
  \begin{itemize}

  \item Added the ability to define SCRIPTS, VARS, etc., for all nodes
  in a DAG with a single command (see section~\ref{sec:DAGAllNodes}).
  \Ticket{5729}

  \item Simplified how DAG node priorities work
  (see section~\ref{sec:DAG-SetNodePriority}).
  This means that existing DAGs that use the node priority feature
  will run differently than they have in the past.
  \Ticket{4024}
  \Ticket{5749}

  \item Added the new splice connection feature
  (see section~\ref{sec:DAGSpliceConnections}), which
  allows more flexible dependencies between splices.
  \Ticket{5213}

  \end{itemize}

\item HTCondor can now use IPv6 interfaces; it prefers IPv4 if both
IPv4 and IPv6 are available.
\Ticket{5104}

\item HTCondor now has initial support for Singularity containers
(see section~\ref{sec:singularity-support}).
\Ticket{5828}

\item \Condor{status} can now display a single line of output for
each machine (rather than a line per slot).
\Ticket{5596}

\item A number of improvements to the Python bindings including: submission
\Ticket{5666}
\Ticket{4916};
draining
\Ticket{5507};
per-thread security contexts
\Ticket{5632};
Computing-On-Demand support
\Ticket{5130}; and
multiple query support
\Ticket{5187}

\item Jobs can now be submitted to the Slurm batch scheduling system via
the new \SubmitCmdNI{slurm} type in the grid universe.
\Ticket{5515}

\item Numerous improvements to Docker support, including
\Ticket{5680};
\Ticket{5760};
\Ticket{5761};
\Ticket{5750};
\Ticket{5740};
\Ticket{5609};
\Ticket{5456}


\end{itemize}

Upgrading from the 8.4 series of HTCondor to the 8.6 series will
also introduce changes that administrators and users of sites running
from an older HTCondor version should be aware of when planning an upgrade.
Here is a list of items that administrators should be aware of.

\begin{itemize}

\item Shared port (see section~\ref{sec:shared-port-daemon}) is now
enabled by default; set \MacroNI{USE\_SHARED\_PORT} to \Expr{False} to
disable it.  Note that this configuration macro does not control the HAD or
replication daemon's use of shared port; use \MacroNI{HAD\_USE\_SHARED\_PORT}
or \MacroNI{REPLICATION\_USE\_SHARED\_PORT} instead.  See section
~\ref{sec:HA-configuration} for more details on how to configure HAD (and/or
the replication daemon) to work with shared port, since just activating
shared port without any other configuration change will not work.
\Ticket{3813}
\Ticket{5103}

\item To mitigate performance problems, \MacroNI{LOWPORT} and
\MacroNI{HIGHPORT} no longer restrict outbound port ranges on Windows.  To
re-enable this functionality, set \MacroNI{OUT\_LOWPORT} and
\MacroNI{OUT\_HIGHPORT} (see ~\ref{param:OutLowPort} and
~\ref{param:OutHighPort}).
\Ticket{4711}

\item Cgroups (see section~\ref{sec:CGroupTracking}) are now enabled
by default.  This means that if you
have partitionable slots, jobs need to get \SubmitCmd{request\_memory}
correct.
\Ticket{5936}

\item By default, \Condor{q} queries only the current user's jobs,
unless the current user is a queue superuser or the
\MacroNI{CONDOR\_Q\_ONLY\_MY\_JOBS} configuration macro is set to
\Expr{False}.
\Ticket{5271}

\item Added support for immutable and protected job attributes, which
makes SUBMIT\_REQUIREMENTS more useful
(see section~\ref{param:ImmutableJobAttrs}).
\Ticket{5065}

\item By default, the \Condor{schedd} no longer changes the ownership
of spooled job files (they remain owned by the submitting user).
\Ticket{5226}

\item When \MacroNI{SEC\_ENABLE\_MATCH\_PASSWORD\_AUTHENTICATION} is set
to \Expr{True}, the related authorizations are now automatically enabled.
\Ticket{5304}  (See ~\ref{param:SecEnableMatchPasswordAuthentication}
for details.)

\item The master can now run an administrator-defined script at shutdown;
see section~\ref{param:DefaultMasterShutdownScript} for details.
\Ticket{5590}

\end{itemize}
