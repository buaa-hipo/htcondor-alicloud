\section{\label{sec:History-8-7}Development Release Series 8.7}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-7-2}Version 8.7.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.7.2 released on June 22, 2017.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Issues:

\begin{itemize}

\item Our current implementation of late materialization is incompatible with
\Condor{dagman} and will cause unexpected behavior, including failing without
warning. This is a top-priority issue which aim to resolve in an upcoming
release.
\Ticket{6292}

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Improved the performance of the \Condor{schedd} by setting the
default for the knob \MacroNI{SUBMIT\_SKIP\_FILECHECKS} to true.  This prevents
the \Condor{schedd} from checking the readability of all input files, and skips
the creation of the output files on the submit side at submit time.
Output files are now created either at transfer time, when file transfer
is on, or by the job itself, if a shared filesystem is used.  As a result
of this change, it is possible that a job will run to completion, and only
then is put on hold because the output file on the submit machine cannot
be written.
\Ticket{6220}

\item Changed \Condor{submit} to not create empty stdout and stderr files before
submitting jobs by default.  This caused confusion for users, and slowed down
the submission process.  The older behavior, where \Condor{submit} would fail
if it could not create this files, is available when the parameter
\MacroNI{SUBMIT\_SKIP\_FILECHECKS} is set to false.  The default is now true.
\Ticket{6220}

\item \Condor{q} will now show expanded totals when querying a \Condor{schedd} that is version 8.7.1 or later.
The totals for the current user and for all users are provided by the \Condor{schedd}.
To get the old totals display set the configuration parameter \MacroNI{CONDOR\_Q\_SHOW\_OLD\_SUMMARY} to true.
\Ticket{6254}

\item The \Condor{annex} tool now logs to the user configuration directory.  Added an
audit log of \Condor{annex} commands and their results.
\Ticket{6267}

\item Changed \Condor{off} so that the \Expr{-annex} flag implies the
\Expr{-master} flag, since this is more likely to be the right thing.
\Ticket{6266}

\item Added \Expr{-status} flag to \Condor{annex}, which reports on
instances which are running but not in the pool.
\Ticket{6257}

\item If invoked with an annex name and duration (but not an instance or slot
count), \Condor{annex} will now adjust the duration of the named annex.
\Ticket{6161}

\item Job input files which are downloaded from http:// web addresses now
have mechanisms to recover from transfer failures. This should increase the
reliability of using web-based input files, especially under slow and/or
unstable network conditions.
\Ticket{5886}

\item Reduced load on the \Condor{collector} by optimizing queries performed when
an HTCondor daemon needs to look up the address of another daemon.
\Ticket{6223}

\item Reduced load on the \Condor{collector} by optimizing queries performed
when using \condor{q} with several different command-line options such as
\Opt{-submitter} and \Opt{-global}.
\Ticket{6222}

\item Added the \Condor{top} tool,
an automated version of the now-defunct \Condor{top.pl}
which uses the python bindings to monitor the status of daemons.
\Ticket{6205}

\item Added a new option \Opt{-cron} to \Condor{gpu\_discovery} that allows it to be
used directly as an executable of a \Condor{startd} cron job.
\Ticket{6012}

\item The configuration variable \MacroNI{MAX\_RUNNING\_SCHEDULER\_JOBS\_PER\_OWNER}
was set to default to 100. It formerly had no default value.
\Ticket{6260}

\item Added a parameter \MacroNI{DEDICATED\_SCHEDULER\_USE\_SERIAL\_CLAIMS} which
defaults to false.  When true, allows the dedicated schedule to use claimed/idle
slots that the serial scheduler has claimed.
\Ticket{6276}

\item The \Condor{advertise} tool now assumes an update command if one is not
specified on the command-line and attempts to determine exact command by
inspecting the first ad to be advertised.
\Ticket{6296}

\item Improved support for running several \Condor{negotiator}s in a
single pool.
\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_NAME} now works like \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME}.
\Condor{userprio} has a -name option to select a specific
\Condor{negotiator}.
Accounting ads from multiple \Condor{negotiator}s can co-exist in the
\Condor{collector}.
\Ticket{5717}

\item Package EC2 Annex components in the condor-annex-ec2 sub RPM.
\Ticket{6202}

\item Added configuration parameter \MacroNI{ALTERNATE\_JOB\_SPOOL},
an expression evaluated against the job ad, which specifies an alternate
spool directory to use for files related to that job.
\Ticket{6221}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item With an empty configuration file, HTCondor would behave as if
\MacroNI{ALLOW\_ADMINISTRATOR} were \Expr{*}.  Changed the default to
\Expr{\$(CONDOR\_HOST)}, which is much less insecure.
\Ticket{6230}

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{schedd} where it did not account for the initial state of
late materialize jobs when calculating the running totals of jobs by state. This bug
resulted in \Condor{q} displaying incorrect totals when \MacroNI{CONDOR\_Q\_SHOW\_OLD\_SUMMARY}
was set to false.
\Ticket{6272}

\item Fixed a bug where the \Condor{schedd} would incorrectly try to check the
validity of output files and directories for late materialize jobs. The \Condor{schedd}
will now always skip file checks for late materialize jobs.
\Ticket{6246}

\item Changed the output of the \Condor{status} command so that the Load Average
field now displays the load average of just the condor job running in that
slot.  Previously, load associated from outside of condor was proportionately
distributed into the condor slots, resulting in much confusion.
\Ticket{6225}

\item Illegal chars ('+', '.') are now prohibited in DAGMan node names.
\Ticket{5966}

\item Improve audit log messages by including the connection ID and properly
filtering out shadow and gridmanager modifications to the job queue log.
\Ticket{6289}

\item \Condor{root\_switchboard} has been removed from the release, since
PrivSep is no longer supported.
\Ticket{6259}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-7-1}Version 8.7.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.7.1 released on April 24, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Previously, when the number of forked children processing Collector
queries surpassed the maximum set by the configuration knob \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_WORKERS}, the
Collector handled all new incoming queries in-processes (i.e. without
forking). As processing a query and sending out the result to the network
could take a long time, the result of servicing such queries in-process in
the Collector is likely to drop a lot of updates. So now in v8.7.1, instead of
servicing such queries in-process, they are queued up for servicing as soon as
query worker child processes become available.  The configuration knob
\MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_WORKERS\_PENDING} was introduced; see
section\~ref{param:CollectorQueryWorkersPending}.
\Ticket{6192}

\item Default value for \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_WORKERS} changed from 2 to 4.
\Ticket{6192}

\item Introduced configuration macro
\MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_WORKERS\_RESERVE\_FOR\_HIGH\_PRIO} so that the
collector prioritizes queries that are important for the operation of the
pool (such as queries from the negotiator) ahead of servicing user
invocations of \Condor{status}.
\Ticket{6192}

\item Introduced configuration macro \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_MAX\_WORKTIME} to
define the maximum amount of time the collector may service a query from a
client like condor\_status.  See section\~ref{param:CollectorQueryMaxWorktime}.
\Ticket{6192}

\item Added several new statistics on collector query performance into the Collector
ClassAd, including \AdAttr{ActiveQueryWorkers}, \AdAttr{ActiveQueryWokersPeak},
\AdAttr{PendingQueries}, \AdAttr{PendingQueriesPeak}, \AdAttr{DroppedQueries},
and \AdAttr{RecentDroppedQueries}.  See section\~ref{sec:Collector-ClassAd-Attributes}.
\Ticket{6192}

\item Further refinement and initial documentation of the HTCondor Annex.
\Ticket{6147}
\Ticket{6149}
\Ticket{6150}
\Ticket{6155}
\Ticket{6157}
\Ticket{6184}
\Ticket{6196}
\Ticket{6216}
\Ticket{6218}

\item Docker universe jobs can now use condor\_chirp command
(if it is in the image).
\Ticket{6162}

\item In the Job Router, when a candidate job matches multiple routes,
the first route is now always selected.
The old behavior of spreading jobs across all matching routes round-robin
style can be enabled by setting the new configuration parameter
\MacroNI{JOB\_ROUTER\_ROUND\_ROBIN\_SELECTION} to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{6190}

\item The \Condor{schedd} now keeps a count of jobs by state for each owner and submitter
and will report them to \Condor{q}. Condor{q} will display these totals unless the new
configuration parameter \MacroNI{CONDOR\_Q\_SHOW\_OLD\_SUMMARY} is set to true. In 8.7.1
this parameter defaults to true.
\Ticket{6160}

\item Milestone 1 for late materialization in the \Condor{schedd} was completed. This milestone adds the
undocumented option \Opt{-factory} to \Condor{q} that can be used to submit a late materializing job cluster
to the \Condor{schedd}.  The \Condor{schedd} will refuse the submission unless the configuration parameter
\MacroNI{SCHEDD\_ALLOW\_LATE\_MATERIALIZATION} is set to true.
\Ticket{6212}

\item Increased the default value for configuration parameter
\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_SOCKET\_CACHE\_SIZE} to 500.
\Ticket{6165}

\item Added new DaemonCore statistics UdpQueueDepth to measure the
number of bytes in the UDP receive queue for daemons with a UDP command port.
\Ticket{6183}

\item Improved speed of handling queries to the collector by caching the
the configuration knob SHARED\_PORT\_ADDRESS\_REWRITING.
\Ticket{6187}

\item The \Condor{collector} on Linux now handles some queries in process and some
by forking a child process. This allows it to avoid the overhead of forking to handle
queries that will take little time. The policy for deciding which queries to handle in process
is controlled by a new configuration parameter \MacroNI{HANDLE\_QUERY\_IN\_PROC\_POLICY}.
\Ticket{6191}

\item Added \Opt{-limit} option to \Condor{status} and changed the \Condor{collector} to honor it.
\Ticket{6198}

\item \Condor{submit} was changed to use the same utility library that the submit python bindings use.
This should help insure that submit via python bindings will give the same results as using \Condor{submit}.
\Ticket{6181}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-7-0}Version 8.7.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.7.0 released on March 2, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Optimized the code that reads reads ClassAds off the wire making the maximum possible update rate
for the Collector about 1.7 times higher than it was before.
\Ticket{6105}
\Ticket{6130}

\item New statistics have been added to the Collector ad to show time spent handling queries.
\Ticket{6123}

\item Changed the formatting of the printing of ClassAd expressions with
parentheses. Now there is no space character after every open parenthesis, or
before every close parenthesis
This looks more natural, is somewhat faster for the condor to parse, and
saves space.  That is, an expression that used to print like

\begin{verbatim}
( ( ( foo ) ) )
\end{verbatim}
now will print like this
\begin{verbatim}
(((foo)))
\end{verbatim}
\Ticket{6082}

\item Technology preview of the HTCondor Annex. The HTCondor Annex allows one
to extend their HTCondor pool into the cloud.
\URL{https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=HowToUseCondorAnnexWithOnDemandInstances}
\Ticket{6121}

\item Added \Opt{-annex} option to \Condor{status} and \Condor{off}.  Requires
an argument; the request is constrained to match machines whose
\Expr{AnnexName} ClassAd attribute matches the argument.
\Ticket{6116}
\Ticket{6117}

\item A refreshed X.509 proxy is now forwarded to the remote cluster
in Bosco.
\Ticket{5841}

\item Added several new statistics to the Negotiator ad, mainly
detailing how time is spent in the negotiation cycle.
\Ticket{6060}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Removed redundant updates to the job queue by the Job Router.
\Ticket{6102}

\end{itemize}
