\section{\label{sec:Contrib-Install}Contrib Module Installation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section describes how to install various \Term{contrib modules}
in the Condor system.
Some of these modules are separate, optional pieces, not included in
the main distribution of Condor.
Others are integral parts of Condor taken from the development series
that have certain features users might want to install.
Examples are the new SMP-aware \Condor{startd} and the CondorView
collector.  
Both of these modules come with Condor version 6.1 and
later versions.
However, 
these separate modules may be installed,
maintaining most of the stable release,
while not
switching over to using the
development binaries.
