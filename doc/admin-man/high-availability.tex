\index{High Availability}

In the case that a key machine no longer functions,
HTCondor can be configured such that another machine takes on
the key functions.
This is called \emph{High Availability}.
While high availability is generally applicable,
there are currently two specialized cases for its use:
when the central manager 
(running the \Condor{negotiator} and \Condor{collector} daemons)
becomes unavailable,
and when the machine running the \Condor{schedd}
daemon (maintaining the job queue) becomes unavailable.
