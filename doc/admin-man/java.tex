Compiled Java programs may be executed (under HTCondor) on
any
execution site with a
\index{Java Virtual Machine}
\index{JVM}
Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
To do this,
HTCondor must be informed of some details of the
JVM installation.

Begin by installing a Java distribution according to the vendor's
instructions.
Your machine may have
been delivered with a JVM already installed -- installed code
is frequently found in \File{/usr/bin/java}.

HTCondor's configuration includes the location of the installed
JVM.
Edit the configuration file.
Modify the \Macro{JAVA} entry to point to the JVM binary,
typically \File{/usr/bin/java}.
Restart the \Condor{startd} daemon on that host.  For example,

\begin{verbatim}
% condor_restart -startd bluejay
\end{verbatim}

The \Condor{startd} daemon takes a few moments to exercise the Java
capabilities of the \Condor{starter}, query its properties,
and then advertise the machine
to the pool as Java-capable.
If the set up succeeded, then \Condor{status} will
tell you the host is now Java-capable by printing the Java
vendor and the version number:

\begin{verbatim}
% condor_status -java bluejay
\end{verbatim}

After a suitable amount of time, if this command does not give any output,
then the \Condor{starter}  is having difficulty executing the JVM.
The exact cause of the problem depends on the details of the
JVM, the local installation, and a variety of other factors.
We can offer only limited advice on these matters,
but here is an approach to solving the problem.

To reproduce the test that the \Condor{starter} is attempting,
try running the Java \Condor{starter} directly.  To find
where the \Condor{starter} is installed, run this command:

\begin{verbatim}
% condor_config_val STARTER
\end{verbatim}

This command prints out the path to the \Condor{starter},
perhaps something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
/usr/condor/sbin/condor_starter
\end{verbatim}

Use this path to execute the \Condor{starter} directly
with the \Arg{-classad} argument.
This tells the starter to run its tests and display its properties.

\begin{verbatim}
/usr/condor/sbin/condor_starter -classad
\end{verbatim}

This command will display a short list of cryptic properties, such as:

\begin{verbatim}
IsDaemonCore = True
HasFileTransfer = True
HasMPI = True
CondorVersion = "$CondorVersion: 7.1.0 Mar 26 2008 BuildID: 80210 $"
\end{verbatim}

If the Java configuration is correct, there will also
be a short list of Java properties, such as:

\begin{verbatim}
JavaVendor = "Sun Microsystems Inc."
JavaVersion = "1.2.2"
JavaMFlops = 9.279696
HasJava = True
\end{verbatim}

If the Java installation is incorrect, then any error
messages from the shell or Java will be printed
on the error stream instead.

Many implementations of the JVM set a value of the Java maximum heap size
that is too small for particular applications.
HTCondor uses this value.
The administrator can change this value through configuration by setting
a different value for \Macro{JAVA\_EXTRA\_ARGUMENTS}.

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
JAVA_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS = -Xmx1024m
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Note that if a specific job sets the value in the submit description
file, using the submit command \SubmitCmd{java\_vm\_args},
the job's value takes precedence over a configured value.
