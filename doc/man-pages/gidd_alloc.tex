\Synopsis \SynProg{gidd\_alloc}
\Arg{min-gid}
\Arg{max-gid}

\Description 

This program will scan the alive PIDs, looking for which GID is unused in
the supplied, inclusive range specified by the required arguments
\Arg{min-gid} and \Arg{max-gid}. 
Upon finding one,
it will add the GID to its own supplementary group list,
and then scan the PIDs again expecting to find only itself using the GID. 
If no collision has occurred, the program exits, otherwise it retries.
