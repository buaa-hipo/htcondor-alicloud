\Description

\Condor{submit} is the program for submitting jobs for execution
under HTCondor.
\Condor{submit} requires a submit description file which contains commands
to direct the queuing of jobs.
One submit description file may contain
specifications for the queuing of many HTCondor jobs at once.
A single invocation of \Condor{submit} may cause one or
more clusters.
A cluster is a set of jobs
specified in the submit description file
between \SubmitCmd{queue} commands for which the executable is not changed.
It is advantageous to submit
multiple jobs as a single cluster because:
\begin{itemize}
\item Only one copy of the checkpoint file is needed to 
represent all jobs in a cluster until they begin execution.
\item There is much less overhead involved for HTCondor to start the next
job in a cluster than for HTCondor to start a new cluster.  This can make
a big difference when submitting lots of short jobs.
\end{itemize}

Multiple clusters may be specified within a single
submit description file.
Each cluster must specify a single executable.

The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{ClusterId} identifies a cluster.

The \Arg{submit description file} argument is the path and file name of 
the submit description file. 
If this optional argument is missing or is the dash character (\Expr{-}),
then the commands are taken from standard input.  If \Expr{-} is
specified for the \Arg{submit description file}, \Opt{-verbose} is
implied; this can be overridden by specifying \Opt{-terse}.

Note that submission of jobs from a Windows machine requires
a stashed password to allow HTCondor to impersonate the user submitting
the job.
To stash a password, use the \Condor{store\_cred} command.
See the manual page for details.

For lengthy lines within the submit description file,
the backslash (\Bs) is a line continuation character.
Placing the backslash at the end of a line causes the current line's command
to be continued with the next line of the file.
Submit description files may contain comments.
A comment is any line beginning with a pound character (\verb@#@). 

\begin{Options}

\OptItem{\Opt{-terse}}{Terse output - display JobId ranges only.}

\OptItem{\Opt{-verbose}}{Verbose output - display the created job ClassAd}

\OptItem{\Opt{-unused}}{As a default, causes no warnings to be issued about
  user-defined macros not being used within the submit description file.
  The meaning reverses (toggles) when
  the configuration variable \Macro{WARN\_ON\_UNUSED\_SUBMIT\_FILE\_MACROS}
  is set to the non default value of \Expr{False}.
  Printing the warnings can help identify spelling
  errors of submit description file commands.  The warnings are sent
  to stderr. }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-name}{schedd\_name}}{Submit to the specified \Condor{schedd}.
Use this option to submit to a \Condor{schedd} other than the default local one.
\Arg{schedd\_name} is the value of the \Attr{Name} ClassAd attribute on
the machine where the \Condor{schedd} daemon runs.}


\OptItem{\OptArg{-remote}{schedd\_name}}{Submit to the specified
\Condor{schedd}, spooling all required input files over the network connection.
\Arg{schedd\_name} is the value of the \Attr{Name} ClassAd attribute
on the machine where the \Condor{schedd} daemon runs.
This option is equivalent to using both \Opt{-name} and \Opt{-spool}.}

\OptItem{\OptArg{-addr}{\Sinful{ip:port}}}{Submit to the \Condor{schedd} at
the IP address and port given by the \Term{sinful string} argument 
\Arg{\Sinful{ip:port}}.}

\OptItem{\OptArg{-pool}{pool\_name}}{Look in the specified pool for the 
\Condor{schedd} to submit to.
This option is used with \Opt{-name} or \Opt{-remote}.}

\OptItem{\Opt{-disable}}{Disable file permission checks
  when submitting a job for read permissions on all input files, 
  such as those defined by 
  commands \SubmitCmd{input} and \SubmitCmd{transfer\_input\_files},
  as well as write permission to output files, such as a
  log file defined by \SubmitCmd{log} and output files defined with 
  \SubmitCmd{output} or \SubmitCmd{transfer\_output\_files}.  }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-password}{passphrase}}{Specify a password to the 
\Prog{MyProxy} server. }

\OptItem{\Opt{-debug}}{Cause debugging information to be sent to \File{stderr},
based on the value of the configuration variable \MacroNI{TOOL\_DEBUG}.}

\OptItem{\OptArg{-append}{command}}{Augment the commands in the submit 
  description file with the given \Arg{command}.
  This command will be considered to immediately precede the \SubmitCmdNI{queue}
  command within the submit description file, and come after all other
  previous commands.
  If the \Arg{command} specifies a \SubmitCmdNI{queue} command,
  as in the example

  \Expr{condor\_submit mysubmitfile -append "queue input in A, B, C"} 

  then the entire \Opt{-append} command line option and its arguments
  are converted to

  \Expr{condor\_submit mysubmitfile -queue input in A, B, C} 

  The submit description file is not modified.
  Multiple commands are specified by using the \Opt{-append} option 
  multiple times.
  Each new command is given in a separate \Opt{-append} option.
  Commands with spaces in them will need to be enclosed in double quote
  marks. }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-batch-name}{batch\_name}}{Set the batch name for this submit.
  The batch name is displayed by \Condor{q} \Opt{-batch}.  It is intended
  for use by users to give meaningful names to their jobs and to influence
  how \Condor{q} groups jobs for display. Use of this argument
  takes precedence over a batch name specified in the submit description
  file itself. }

\OptItem{\Opt{-spool}}{Spool all required input files, job event log, and
proxy over the connection to the \Condor{schedd}.
After submission, modify
local copies of the files without affecting your jobs. Any output
files for completed jobs need to be retrieved with \Condor{transfer\_data}.}

\OptItem{\OptArg{-dump}{filename}}{Sends all ClassAds to the specified
  file, instead of to the \Condor{schedd}.}

\OptItem{\Opt{-interactive}}{Indicates
  that the user wants to run an interactive shell on an execute machine 
  in the pool.
  This is equivalent to creating a submit description file 
  of a vanilla universe sleep job, 
  and then running \Condor{ssh\_to\_job} by hand.
  Without any additional arguments, 
  \Condor{submit} with the -interactive flag creates a dummy
  vanilla universe job that sleeps, 
  submits it to the local scheduler, 
  waits for the job to run, 
  and then launches \Condor{ssh\_to\_job} to run a shell.
  If the user would like to run the shell on a machine that matches 
  a particular \SubmitCmd{requirements} expression, 
  the submit description file is specified, and it will contain the expression.
  Note that all policy expressions specified in the submit 
  description file are honored, but any \SubmitCmd{executable} or
  \SubmitCmd{universe} commands are overwritten to be sleep and vanilla.
  The job ClassAd attribute \Attr{InteractiveJob} is set to \Expr{True}
  to identify interactive jobs for \Condor{startd} policy usage.  }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-dry-run}{file}}{Parse the submit description file,
  sending the resulting job ClassAd to the file given by \Arg{file}, but
  do not submit the job(s).
  This permits observation of the job specification, 
  and it facilitates debugging the submit description file contents.
  If \Arg{file} is \Opt{-}, the output is written to \File{stdout}. }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-maxjobs}{number-of-jobs}}{If the total number
  of jobs specified by the submit description file is more than
  the integer value given by \Arg{number-of-jobs}, 
  then no jobs are submitted for execution and an error message is generated. 
  A 0 or negative value for the \Arg{number-of-jobs}
  causes no limit to be imposed. }

\OptItem{\Opt{-single-cluster}}{If the jobs specified by the submit description
  file causes more than a single cluster value to be assigned,
  then no jobs are submitted for execution and an error message is generated. }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-stm}{method}}{Specify the method use to move a sandbox
  into HTCondor.  \Arg{method} is one of \Opt{stm\_use\_schedd\_only}
  or \Opt{stm\_use\_transferd}.}

\OptItem{\Opt{<submit-variable>=<value>}}{Defines a submit command or
  submit variable with a value, and parses it as if it was placed at
  the beginning of the submit description file.
  The submit description file is not changed.
  To correctly parse the \Condor{submit} command line,
  this option must be specified without white space characters before and
  after the equals sign (\Expr{=}),
  or the entire option must be surrounded by double quote marks.  }

\OptItem{\OptArg{-queue}{queue\_arguments}}{A command line specification
  of how many jobs to queue, which is only permitted if the submit description
  file does not have a \SubmitCmdNI{queue} command.
  The \Arg{queue\_arguments} are the same as may be within a submit
  description file.
  The parsing of the \Arg{queue\_arguments} finishes at the end of the
  line or when a dash character (\Expr{-}) is encountered. 
  Therefore, its best placement within the command line will be at the end
  of the command line. 

  On a Unix command line, the shell expands file globs before parsing
  occurs. }

\end{Options}

\index{submit commands}

Note: more information on submitting HTCondor jobs can be found
here: ~\ref{sec:submitting}.

As of version 8.5.6, the \Condor{submit} language supports multi-line
values in commands.  The syntax is the same as the configuration
language (see more details here: ~\ref{sec:Multi-Line-Values}).

\input{man-pages/submitcmds.tex}

\subsection*{Submit Variables}
\index{condor\_submit variables}

While processing the \SubmitCmd{queue} command in a submit file or from the command line, \Condor{submit} will
set the values of several automatic submit variables so that they can be referred to by statements in the
submit file. With the exception of Cluster and Process, if these variables are set by the submit file, they will
not be modified during \SubmitCmd{queue} processing.

\begin{description}
\item[ClusterId]
Set to the integer value that the \Attr{ClusterId} attribute that the job ClassAd will have when the job is submitted.
All jobs in a single submit will normally have the same value for the \Attr{ClusterId}.
If the \Opt{-dry-run} argument is specified, The value will be 1.

\item[Cluster]
Alternate name for the ClusterId submit variable.  Before HTCondor version 8.4 this was the only name.

\item[ProcId]
Set to the integer value that the \Attr{ProcId} attribute of the job ClassAd will have when the job is submitted.
The value will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each job submitted.

\item[Process]
Alternate name for the ProcId submit variable.  Before HTCondor version 8.4 this was the only name.

\item[Node]
For parallel universes, set to the value \#pArAlLeLnOdE\# or \#MpInOdE\# depending on the parallel universe type
For other universes it is set to nothing.

\item[Step]
Set to the step value as it varies from 0 to N-1 where N is the number provided on the \SubmitCmd{queue} argument.
This variable changes at the same rate as ProcId when it changes at all.
For submit files that don't make use of the queue number option, Step will always be 0.
For submit files that don't make use of any of the foreach options, Step and ProcId will always be the same.

\item[ItemIndex]
Set to the index within the item list being processed by the various queue foreach options.
For submit files that don't make use of any queue foreach list, ItemIndex will always be 0
For submit files that make use of a slice to select only some items in a foreach list, ItemIndex will only
be set to selected values.

\item[Row]
Alternate name for ItemIndex.

\item[Item]
when a queue foreach option is used and no variable list is supplied, this variable will be set to the
value of the current item.
\end{description}


% Note:  I'm not sure bolding this is the best thing, but I wanted to
% it stand out and not seem like part of Item...  (wenger 2016-07-29)
\Bold{The automatic variables below are set before parsing the submit
file, and will not vary during processing unless the submit file itself
sets them.}

\begin{description}
\item[ARCH]
Set to the CPU architecture of the machine running \Condor{submit}.
The value will be the same as the automatic configuration variable of the same name.

\item[OPSYS]
Set to the name of the operating system on the machine running \Condor{submit}.
The value will be the same as the automatic configuration variable of the same name.

\item[OPSYSANDVER]
Set to the name and major version of the operating system on the machine running \Condor{submit}.
The value will be the same as the automatic configuration variable of the same name.

\item[OPSYSMAJORVER]
Set to the major version of the operating system on the machine running \Condor{submit}.
The value will be the same as the automatic configuration variable of the same name.

\item[OPSYSVER]
Set to the version of the operating system on the machine running \Condor{submit}.
The value will be the same as the automatic configuration variable of the same name.

\item[SPOOL]
Set to the full path of the HTCondor spool directory.
The value will be the same as the automatic configuration variable of
the same name.

\item[IsLinux]
Set to true if the operating system of the machine running \Condor{submit} is a Linux variant.
Set to false otherwise.

\item[IsWindows]
Set to true if the operating system of the machine running \Condor{submit} is a Microsoft Windows variant.
Set to false otherwise.

\item[SUBMIT\_FILE]
Set to the full pathname of the submit file being processed by \Condor{submit}. If submit statements
are read from standard input, it is set to nothing.
\end{description}

\ExitStatus

\Condor{submit} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and a
non-zero value upon failure.

\Examples

\begin{itemize} 
\item{Submit Description File Example 1:} This example queues three jobs for
execution by HTCondor. The first will be given command line arguments of
\Arg{15} and \Arg{2000}, and it will write its standard output
to \File{foo.out1}.
The second will be given command line arguments of 
\Arg{30} and \Arg{2000}, and it will
write its standard output to \File{foo.out2}.
Similarly the third will have
arguments of 
\Arg{45} and \Arg{6000}, and it will use \File{foo.out3} for its standard
output. Standard error output (if any) from all three programs will
appear in \File{foo.error}.

Note that each of the added commands is contained within quote marks
because there are space characters within the command.

\item{\AdAttr{periodic\_remove} example:}
A job should be removed from the queue,
if the total suspension time of the job
is more than half of the run time of the job.

Including the command

\begin{verbatim}
   periodic_remove = CumulativeSuspensionTime > 
                     ((RemoteWallClockTime - CumulativeSuspensionTime) / 2.0)

\GenRem
\begin{itemize}

\item For security reasons, HTCondor will refuse to run any jobs submitted
by user root (UID = 0) or by a user whose default group is group wheel
(GID = 0). Jobs submitted by user root or a user with a default group of
wheel will appear to sit forever in the queue in an idle state. 

\item All path names specified in the submit description file must be
less than 256 characters in length, and command line arguments must be
less than 4096 characters in length; otherwise, \Condor{submit} gives a
warning message but the jobs will not execute properly. 

\item Somewhat understandably, behavior gets bizarre if the user makes
the mistake of requesting multiple HTCondor jobs to write to the
same file, and/or if the user alters any files that need to be accessed
by an HTCondor job which is still in the queue.
For example, the compressing of data or
output files before an HTCondor job has completed is a common mistake.

\item To disable checkpointing for Standard Universe jobs, include the
line:
\begin{verbatim}
      +WantCheckpoint = False
\end{verbatim}
in the submit description file before the queue command(s).
