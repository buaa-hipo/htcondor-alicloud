\Description

\Condor{check\_userlogs} is a program for checking a job event log or
a set of job event logs for errors.  
Output includes an indication that no errors were found
within a log file,
or a list of errors such as an
execute or terminate event without a corresponding submit event,
or multiple terminated events for the same job.

\Condor{check\_userlogs} is especially useful for debugging
\Condor{dagman} problems.  If \Condor{dagman} reports an error
it is often useful to run \Condor{check\_userlogs} on the relevant
log files.

\ExitStatus

\Condor{check\_userlogs} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero)
upon success, and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
