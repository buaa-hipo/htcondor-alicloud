\Description 

\Condor{reconfig} reconfigures all of the HTCondor daemons in accordance with 
the current
status of the HTCondor configuration file(s).  
Once reconfiguration is complete, the daemons will behave according to
the policies stated in the configuration file(s).
The main exception is with the \MacroNI{DAEMON\_LIST} variable,
which will only be
updated if the \Condor{restart} command is used.  
Other configuration variables that can only be changed
if the HTCondor daemons are restarted are listed in
the HTCondor manual in the section on configuration.
In general, \Condor{reconfig} should be used when making changes to
the configuration files, since it is faster and more efficient than
restarting the daemons.

The command 
\Condor{reconfig}
with no arguments or with the \OptArg{-daemon}{master} option 
will cause the reconfiguration of the \Condor{master}
daemon and all the child processes of the \Condor{master}.

For security reasons of authentication and authorization,
this command requires ADMINISTRATOR level of access.

\ExitStatus

\Condor{reconfig} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.

\Examples
To reconfigure the \Condor{master} and all its children
on the local host:
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_reconfig
\end{verbatim}

To reconfigure only the \Condor{startd} on a named machine:
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_reconfig -name bluejay -daemon startd
\end{verbatim}

To reconfigure a machine within a pool
other than the local pool, use the \Opt{-pool} option.
The argument is the name of the central manager for the pool.
Note that one or more machines within the pool must be
specified as the targets for the command.
This command reconfigures
the single machine named \Opt{cae17} within the
pool of machines that has \Opt{condor.cae.wisc.edu} as
its central manager:
\begin{verbatim}
% condor_reconfig -pool condor.cae.wisc.edu -name cae17
\end{verbatim}
