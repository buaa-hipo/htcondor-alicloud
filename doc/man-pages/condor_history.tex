\Description
\Condor{history} displays a summary of all HTCondor jobs listed in the
specified history files.
If no history files are specified with the \Opt{-file} option, 
the local history file as specified in HTCondor's configuration file
(\File{\MacroUNI{SPOOL}/history} by default) is read.  
The default listing summarizes in reverse chronological order
each job on a single line, and  contains the following items:


\begin{description}
\item[ID] The cluster/process id of the job. 
\item[OWNER] The owner of the job. 
\item[SUBMITTED] The month, day, hour, and minute the job was submitted to the queue. 
\item[RUN\_TIME] Remote wall clock time accumulated by the job to date in days, hours, minutes, and seconds,  given as the job ClassAd attribute
\AdAttr{RemoteWallClockTime}.
\item[ST] Completion status of the job (C = completed and X = removed).
\item[COMPLETED] The time the job was completed.
\item[CMD] The name of the executable. 
\end{description}

If a job ID (in the form of \Argnm{cluster\_id} or \Argnm{cluster\_id.proc\_id}) or an
\Argnm{owner} is provided, output will be restricted to jobs with the
specified IDs and/or submitted by the specified owner.  
The \Argnm{-constraint} option can be used to display jobs that satisfy a
specified boolean expression.

The history file is kept in chronological order,
implying that new entries are appended at the end of the
file.
As of Condor version 6.7.19,
the format of the history file is altered to enable faster
reading of the history file backwards (most recent job first).
History files written with earlier versions of Condor,
as well as those that have entries of both
the older and newer format
need to be converted to the new format.
See the \Condor{convert\_history} manual page 
on page~\pageref{man-condor-convert-history}
for details on converting history files to the new format.

\begin{Options}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-help}}{Display usage information and exit.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-name}{name}}{Query the named \Condor{schedd} daemon. }
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-pool}{centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]}}
    {Use the \Argnm{centralmanagerhostname} as
    the central manager to locate \Condor{schedd} daemons.
    The default is the \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_HOST},
    as specified in the configuration.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-backwards}}{List jobs in reverse chronological
    order. The job most recently added to the history file is first.
    This is the default ordering.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-forwards}}{List jobs in chronological
    order. The job most recently added to the history file is last.
    At least 4 characters must be given to distinguish this option
    from the \Opt{-file} and \Opt{-format} options. }
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-constraint}{expr}}{Display jobs that satisfy the
    expression.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-attributes}{attrs}}{Display only the given attributes when
  the \OptArg{-long} option is used.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-since}{jobid or expr}}{Stop scanning when the given jobid is found
  or when the expression becomes true.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-local}}{Read from local history files even if there is a \Macro{SCHEDD\_HOST}
  configured.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-file}{filename}}{Use the specified file instead of the
    default history file.  }
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-userlog}{filename}}{Display jobs, with job information
    coming from a job event log,
    instead of from the default history file.
    A job event log does not contain all of the job information, so some fields in
    the normal output of \Condor{history} will be blank.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-format}{formatString}{AttributeName}}{Display jobs
    with a custom format. See the \Condor{q} man page \Opt{-format} option
    for details.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-autoformat[:jlhVr,tng]}{attr1 [attr2 ...]} 
  or \OptArg{-af[:jlhVr,tng]}{attr1 [attr2 ...]}} {
    (output option) Display attribute(s) or expression(s)
    formatted in a default way according to attribute types.  
    This option takes an arbitrary number of attribute names as arguments,
    and prints out their values, 
    with a space between each value and a newline character after 
    the last value.  
    It is like the \Opt{-format} option without format strings.

    It is assumed that no attribute names begin with a dash character,
    so that the next word that begins with dash is the 
    start of the next option.
    The \Opt{autoformat} option may be followed by a colon character
    and formatting qualifiers to deviate the output formatting from
    the default:

    \textbf{j} print the job ID as the first field,

    \textbf{l} label each field,

    \textbf{h} print column headings before the first line of output,

    \textbf{V} use \%V rather than \%v for formatting (string values
    are quoted),

    \textbf{r} print "raw", or unevaluated values,

    \textbf{,} add a comma character after each field,

    \textbf{t} add a tab character before each field instead of 
    the default space character,

    \textbf{n} add a newline character after each field,

    \textbf{g} add a newline character between ClassAds, and
    suppress spaces before each field.

    Use \textbf{-af:h} to get tabular values with headings.

    Use \textbf{-af:lrng} to get -long equivalent format.

    The newline and comma characters may \emph{not} be used together.
    The \textbf{l} and \textbf{h} characters may \emph{not} be used
    together.
    }
  \OptItem{\Opt{-l} or \Opt{-long}}{Display job ClassAds in long format.}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-limit}{Number}}
    {Limit the number of jobs displayed to \Arg{Number}.  Same option as
    \Opt{-match}. }
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-match}{Number}} 
    {Limit the number of jobs displayed to \Arg{Number}. Same option as
    \Opt{-limit}. } 
  \OptItem{\Opt{-xml}}{Display job ClassAds in XML format.
    The XML format is fully defined in the reference manual,
    obtained from the ClassAds web page, with a link at
    \URL{http://htcondor.org/classad/classad.html}.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-json}}{Display job ClassAds in JSON format.}
\end{Options}

\ExitStatus

\Condor{history} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
