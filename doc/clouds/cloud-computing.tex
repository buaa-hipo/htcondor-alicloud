Although HTCondor has long supported accessing cloud resources as though they
were part of the Grid, the differences between clouds and the Grid have
made it difficult to convert access into utility; a job in the Grid universe
starts a virtual machine, rather than the user's executable.

Since version 8.7.0, HTCondor has included a tool, \Condor{annex}, to help
users and administrators use cloud resources to run HTCondor jobs.

This documentation should be considered neither normative nor exhaustive:
it describes parts of \Condor{annex} as it exists and is implemented
in v8.7.2, rather than as it ought to behave.
