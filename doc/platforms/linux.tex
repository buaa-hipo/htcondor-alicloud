This section provides information specific to the Linux port of
HTCondor.
Linux is a difficult platform to support.
It changes frequently, and HTCondor has some extremely
system-dependent code, such as the checkpointing library.

HTCondor is sensitive to changes in the following elements of the
system: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The kernel version
\item The version of the GNU C library (glibc)
\item the version of GNU C Compiler (GCC) used to build and link
  HTCondor jobs. This matters for HTCondor's standard universe, which
  provides checkpoints and remote system calls.
\end{itemize}

The HTCondor Team tries to provide support for various releases of the
distribution of Linux.
Red Hat is probably the most popular Linux distribution, and it
provides a common set of versions for the above system components
at which HTCondor can aim support.
HTCondor will often work with Linux distributions other than Red Hat (for
example, Debian or SuSE) that have the same versions of the above
components.
However, we do not usually test HTCondor on other Linux distributions
and we do not provide any guarantees about this.

New releases of Red Hat usually change the versions of some or all of
the above system-level components.
A version of HTCondor that works with one release of Red Hat might not
work with newer releases.
The following sections describe the details of HTCondor's support for
the currently available versions of Red Hat Linux on x86 architecture
machines.

\subsection{\label{sec:platform-linux-addrspace-random}Linux Address Space Randomization}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{platform-specific information!address space randomization}

Modern versions of Red Hat and Fedora do address space randomization,
which randomizes the memory layout of a process
to reduce the possibility of security exploits. 
This makes it impossible
for standard universe jobs to resume execution using a checkpoint.
When starting or resuming a standard universe job,
HTCondor disables the randomization.

To run a binary compiled with  \Condor{compile} in standalone mode,
either initially or in resumption mode,
manually disable the address space randomization by modifying the
command line.
For a 32-bit architecture, assuming an
HTCondor-linked binary called \Prog{myapp},
invoke the standalone executable with:
\begin{verbatim}
  setarch i386 -L -R ./myapp
\end{verbatim}
For a 64-bit architecture, the resumption command will be: 
\begin{verbatim}
  setarch x86_64 -L -R ./myapp
\end{verbatim}
Some applications will also need the \Opt{-B} option.

The command to resume execution using the checkpoint must also
disable address space randomization, 
as the 32-bit architecture example:
\begin{verbatim}
  setarch i386 -L -R myapp -_condor_restart myapp.ckpt
\end{verbatim}
