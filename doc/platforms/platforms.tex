The HTCondor Team strives to make HTCondor work the same way across all
supported platforms.
However, because HTCondor is a very low-level system which interacts
closely with the internals of the operating systems on which it runs,
this goal is not always possible to achieve.
The following sections provide detailed information about using HTCondor
on different computing platforms and operating systems.
