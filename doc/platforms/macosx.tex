This section provides information specific to the Macintosh OS X port of
HTCondor.
The Macintosh port of HTCondor is more accurately a port of HTCondor to
Darwin, the BSD core of OS X. HTCondor uses the Carbon library only to
detect keyboard activity, and it does not use Cocoa at all.
HTCondor on the Macintosh is a relatively new port, and it 
is not yet well-integrated
into the Macintosh environment. 

HTCondor on the Macintosh has a few shortcomings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Users connected to the Macintosh via \Prog{ssh} are not
noticed for console activity.
\item The memory size of threaded programs is reported incorrectly.
\item No Macintosh-based installer is provided.
\item The example start up scripts do not follow Macintosh conventions.
\item Kerberos is not supported.
\end{itemize}
