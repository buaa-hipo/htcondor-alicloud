Chirp is a wire protocol and API that supports communication between a
running job and a Chirp server.  The HTCondor system provides a Chirp
server running in the \Condor{starter} that allows a job to 
\begin{enumerate}
\item perform file I/O to and from the submit machine
\item update an attribute in its own job ClassAd
\item append the job event log file
\end{enumerate}
This service is off by default; 
it may be enabled by placing in the submit description file: 
\begin{verbatim}
+WantIOProxy = True 
\end{verbatim}
This places the needed attribute into the job ClassAd.

The Chirp protocol is fully documented at 
\URL{http://www3.nd.edu/~ccl/software/chirp}.

To provide easier access to this wire protocol, the \Condor{chirp} 
command line tool is shipped with HTCondor.  
This tool provides full access to the Chirp commands.
