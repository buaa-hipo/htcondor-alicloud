/*
This object transparently converts any CondorFile into a gzipped file.
In general, only sequential access is supported.  Random-access reading
is allowed but is very slow because it is implemented by reading intervening
data.

Only the most basic flavor of compression, as described by the gzip documentation,
is supported.  This seems to interact just fine with normal invocations of
gzip, however, I would not be surprised were there more complicated formats
which this does not understand.
