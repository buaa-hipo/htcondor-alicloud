/** @name DAGMan API Documentation
    DAGMan (Directed Acyclic Graph Manager) is a meta-scheduler for Condor.
    It manages dependencies between jobs at a higher level than the Condor
    Scheduler.  Future plans include exporting a linkable DAGMan API, allowing
    an outside programmer to create, control, and manipulate a DAG through
    the DAGMan API.<p>

    Presently, DAGMan is a stand-alone command line application, and does not
    export a public API.  Thus, the documentation seen here will only be useful
    for the next developer to work on DAGMan itself.<p>

    After the API is created, a outside developer should be able to write their
    own C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, etc program will calls DAGMan API to
    manipulate a DAG (add and delete jobs, add and delete dependencies, even
    while the DAG is running).  DAGMan will export its API in both C++ and C.
    The C interface will allow developer in Java, Perl, and Python use those
    languages' C interface to link with DAGMan.
