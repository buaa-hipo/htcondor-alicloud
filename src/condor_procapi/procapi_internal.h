/* This file is the dumping ground for strange headers that should ONLY pollute
	the procapi source files, not everything that included the procapi.h
	interface header file. Eventually, more things will migrate into here.
	
	An example of something tht could cause this to happen is in Linux, where
	user land header files will have an enum of some symbols but the 
	kernel header files--which the procapi code often uses, would #define
	them. If things get included in just the right way, the #defines will 
	override the symbols in the enum leading to an unparsable mess. */
