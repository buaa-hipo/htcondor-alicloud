Using the mmcs_db_console. The mmcs_db_console does not provide variables like
how I'm using them in these examples. They are only there to show the 
parameterizability of the commands.

Listing generated partitions:
	?

Listing a booted partition's info
	$name = R0-N0-N01
	getblockinfo $name

Listing all booted partitions
	list_blocks

Generating a partition:
	$name = R0-N0-N01
	$sub = R0-M0
	$node = N00
	$size = 32
	gensmallblock $name $sub BGP $size $size $node

Destroying a partition:
	$name = R0-N0-N01
	?

Booting a partition:
	$name = R00-N0-N01
	$type = SMP
	allocate $name htc=$type

Shutting down a partition:
	$name = R00-N0-N01
	free $name
