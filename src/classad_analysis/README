The code in this directory is for three libraries: libanalysis.a,
libconversion.a, and libgangmatch.a as well as a number of test executables.

libanalysis.a is the code for ClassAd analysis and includes the following
files:

 analysis.[h,C]
 boolExpr.[h,C]
 boolValue.[h,C]
 condition.[h,C]
 explain.[h,C]
 interval.[h,C]
 multiProfile.[h,C]
 analysis_instantiate.C
 profile.[h,C]
 resourceGroup.[h,C]
 Stack.h

libconversion.a is the code for converting between old and new Classads and
includes the following files:

 conversion.[h,C]

libgangmatch.a is the code for gangmatching (currently experimental) and
includes the following files:

 gang_instantiate.C
 gangster.[h,C]
 gmr.[h,C]
 portGraph.[h,C]

NOTE: libgangmatch.a is completely independent of the other two libraries.

The following files are for test executables and are built seperately

 boolExpr_test.C
 coll_test.C
 interval_test.C
 start_analyzer.C

 testAEC.C
 testAET.C
 testConversion.C

 testPortGraph.C
