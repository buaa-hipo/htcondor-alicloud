			  Step by Step guide to:
	       Adding new job queue manipulation operations

1> Define a new constant in qmgmt_constants.h

2> Write prototype in qmgmt.tmpl

3> Write prototype in condor_qmgr.h

4> Implement operation in qmgmt.C, preferably by defining a new method
	on either the Job or Cluster object (defined in qmgmt.h).

5> If the operation changes the state of the Job Queue:
	5a> Define new LogRecord subclass in qmgmt_log.h
	5b> Implement log sub-class in qmgmt_log.C
	5c> Implement new case in InstantiateLog in qmgmt_log.C
