/**
 * All Master plugins must subclass MasterPlugin. A Master plugin can
 * receive notification an update is set to the pool's main Collector.
 *
 * The plugin should have a statically initialized instance of itself,
 * which results in MasterPlugin's constructor being called and the
 * plugin being registered.
 *
 * Plugins should be compiled within the source of the Condor version
 * with which they wish to be loaded and with the -shared option,
 * e.g. compile ExampleMasterPlugin.C with:
 *   $ make ExampleMasterPlugin-plugin.so
 *   (in Imakefile)
 *   %-plugin.so: %.C:
 *     $(CPlusPlus) $(C_PLUS_FLAGS) -shared $< -o $@
