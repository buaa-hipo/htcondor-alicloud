/**
 * All Collector plugins must subclass CollectorPlugin. A Collector
 * plugin can receive notification of UPDATE_ and INVALIDATE_ commands
 * received by the Collector.
 *
 * The plugin should have a statically initialized instance of itself,
 * which results in CollectorPlugin's constructor being called and the
 * plugin being registered. See ExampleCollectorPlugin.C for an example.
 *
 * Plugins should be compiled within the source of the Condor version
 * with which they wish to be loaded and with the -shared option,
 * e.g. compile ExampleCollectorPlugin.C with:
 *   $ make ExampleCollectorPlugin-plugin.so
 *   (in Imakefile)
 *   %-plugin.so: %.C:
 *     $(CPlusPlus) $(C_PLUS_FLAGS) -shared $< -o $@
