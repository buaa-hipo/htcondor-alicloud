/**
 * A string space is an efficient way to manage memory for character
 * strings.
 * <p>
 * <b>Introduction:</b>
 * <br>
 * A StringSpace is designed to handle large numbers of immutable
 * string values many of which are logically identical.  In addition,
 * it is assumed that the lifetimes of these values vary widely among
 * individual instances of the values.  The string space structure
 * shares storage for values, and uses a reference to this shared
 * storage.  The storage is maintained by reference counting.  All
 * accesses to the string value are then performed through this
 * reference, which may be copied and deleted without regard to
 * storage managment.

 * <p>
 * <b>Informal comments on usage:</b>
 * <br>
 * The basic object in the system is the StringSpace, of which one may
 * have several non-interfering instances.  The primary method defined
 * on the object is the 'getCanonical' method which enters a ASCIIZ
 * string into the string space, and returns an SSString object.  The
 * SSString object is the reference to the string, and all further
 * accesses to the string should be performed using the SSString
 * object.  (If the string already exists in the string space, a
 * reference to the original string is returned.)  An additional
 * advantage that can be exploited is that each *distinct* string
 * value is given a unique integer ID, with identical strings sharing
 * the same ID.  (e.g., this can be used for fast string equality
 * comparisons!)  The SSString object has operations that can be used
 * to copy and dispose references appropriately.
 * <p>
 * <b>Memory management convention in the StringSpace:</b>
 * <br>
 * The behavior of the StringSpace is that it allocates storage for an
 * inserted string.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> The dispose() method of the SSString is meant to be used
 * in unusual situations only.  Note that the destructor takes care of
 * disposing the reference, so explicitly calling the dispose method
 * may lead to incorrect memory management.  */
