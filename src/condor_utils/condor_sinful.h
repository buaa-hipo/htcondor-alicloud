/*
	HTCondor has three layers of address information.  At the bottom layer,
	a condor_sockaddr represents a data structure that can be passed into the
	kernel and identifies a particular actual endpoint.  It identifies a
	protocol and a protocol-specific address.  For instance, the protocol
	IPv4 splits its address field into "addresses" and "ports".

	The middle layer is an individual source route, a specific sequence of
	connections to make and data to send down those connections.  At present,
	the most complicated individual source route we can implement or
	represent is the following: a shared port daemon in front of a collector,
	a CCB callback, and a shared port daemon in front of the callback's
	return address.  Note that this only requires the client (source) to
	know a single condor_sockaddr: that of the first shared port daemon.

	Sinful internally represents source routes with the SourceRoute class;
	this is presently used only to simplify de/serializaing the v1 string;
	see below.

	(When we change from chooseAddrFromAddrs() to chooseRouteFromAddress(), we
	should return a SourceRoute, but will most likely return a degenerate v1
	Sinful which lists only the single SourceRoute.  This will allow us
	to continue to use Sinful de/serialization exclusively until we switch
	over to passing objects, instead.)

	The upper layer of addressing is a list of all a daemon's source routes
	and the network name associated with each route's condor_sockaddr.  This
	class manages these, highest-level addresses.

	This class used to be a string-manipulation class.  It serialized a
	route's condor_sockaddr with its ip-and-port string, and appended a
	URL-style parameter list which encoded the routing parameters.  Some
	of these (e.g., CCBID, PrivAddr) included one or more serialized
	Sinful strings.

	We refer to strings of that style as "original Sinful strings."  They
	should never be generated*, but for backwards compatibility, we must
	correctly parse them.  Strings of that style which do not include any IPv6
	addresses, and which have only the following parameters, are referred
	to as "v0 Sinful strings".  We generate v0 strings only for backwards-
	compability, and only as part of the ClassAd we return when asked for
	our ClassAd representation.  (*: Work in progress.)

	(Valid v0 parameters are, exclusively: "PrivAddr", "PrivNet", "noUDP",
	"sock", "alias", and "CCBID".  All other parameters will be ignored
	whe generated a v0 string, including the "addrs" parameter set by
	addAddrToAddrs(), or any custom attributes from setParam().)

	For internal usage, we support generating "v1 Sinful strings."  This
	support is born deprecated; whensoever possible, you should simply
	pass the corresponding Sinful object, instead.  A "v1 Sinful string"
	is the canonical serialization of the corresponding ClassAd (as
	returned by getClassad()).

	The v1 ClassAd is a list of ClassAds, each an individual source route,
	each of which must have the following attributes:
		* "a", the address literal (a string)
		* "p", the protocol (a string)
		* "port", the port number (an integer)
		* "n", the network name
	and which may have the following attributes:
		* "alias", a hostname alias for GSI security
		* "CCB", the CCB ID
		* "CCBSharedPort", the shared port ID of the broker
		* "noUDP", a flag (absent if unset) that prevents UDP,
		* "sp", the shared port ID,
	Note that the a, p, port tuple is a serialization of a condor_sockaddr,
	and should arguably be implemented that way.
