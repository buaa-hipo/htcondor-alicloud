/** @name Condor Daemon Client API
    <hr>
    This API is used by Condor daemons and tools to communicate with
    Condor daemons linked with the Condor Daemon Core library.  The
    Daemon object is a generic interface that handles all sorts of
    important, general tasks, like locating the given Daemon via
    various methods, getting information about its version, dealing
    with security sessions for communicating with it, etc.

    The derived subclasses of Daemon, which are specific for what kind
    of daemon you're talking to, implement further specialized
    interfaces for invoking commands each daemon supports.  For
    example, the DCCollector class has a method for sending a ClassAd
    update to the collector (which handles a bunch of details that can
    now be put in one place and hidden from the end user of this
    interface, like should we use UDP or TCP to update, sequence
    numbers to track lost updates, etc, tec).
