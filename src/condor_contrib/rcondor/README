Remote Condor
-------------

Dependencies
------------
ssh
sshfs
Condor (on remote machine)

Description
-----------
Remote Condor allows a user to submit and monitor batch jobs through a remote
instance of Condor from his or her computer without having to install
Condor locally.
Remote Condor will execute the commands through ssh on the remote node.

Installation
------------
From the rcondor/src directory as root run:

make install

By default the root of installation is /usr/local.
To specify a different root specify it in the prefix variable when running
make.  e.g.:

make prefix=/some/other/location install

to uninstall:
make uninstall

Configuration
-------------
You must create a configuration file.
It can either reside in
$HOME/.rcondor/rcondor.conf
or
/etc/rcondor_config

You can use the helper script:
rcondor_configure user@host:dir mountpoint
These argument fields should correspond to your standard sshfs mount command.

It will create these lines:
USR_HOST = user@host
LOCAL = mountpoint
REMOTE = dir
 
Usage
-----
Once properly configured, run:
rcondor_mnt
to create the sshfs mountpoint.

You should unmount it with
rcondor_unmnt
when you don't need it anymore.

Make sure that any paths corresponding to job executables, submit files, and job
output files are located somewhere within the LOCAL path specified in
the configuration file.  
Some commands (e.g. condor_submit) also require that the current working directory 
is within the LOCAL path.

Assuming the installation directory is in the path,
you can now run commands such as 
condor_submit 

followed by the usual arguments.

Most standard Condor commands are supported. 
See $LOCAL/bin for the complete list.
