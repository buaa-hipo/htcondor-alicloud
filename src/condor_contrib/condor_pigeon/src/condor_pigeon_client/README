Condor Contrib - PIGEON

1 - Building:
--------------

Make sure you checked out the entire Condor source tree. Use cmake to build. If you are not using configure_uw , you may need to make cmake aware of your
Qpid install location. 


2 - Running:
-------------

From whereever you execute any of the clients, make sure that your CONDOR_CONFIG variable is set correctly.

a) topic_publisher : 
	This is the client tool for reading Condor UserLog files and publishing them to the queue. Currently it will assume that qpid runs on your localhost. 
	TIt takes two arguments: the userLog file to be published and the persistence file (will be created if it does not exist).
	
	$(CONDOR_BIN)/condor_pigeon_topic_publisher user.log persist.dat
	
	
b) topic_listener : 
	A queue listener that will dump queue input to stdout. No arguments needed. Again, it assumes qpid host is the local machine; port is determined dynamically.
	
	$(CONDOR_BIN)/condor_pigeon_topic_listener
	
c) topic_listener_skype : 
	A queue listener that will post queue messages through Skype to a particular Skype user. This program takes a config file as an argument (i.e. qpidConfig). This config file consists of the following entries (line by line, example enclosed): 
		qpid_host_name  : the name of the host qpid is running on
		log_msg_queue   : the name of the msg queue to subscribe to (should be set to 'log_msg_queue' in the current state)
		routing_key1    : the routing key (currently there is only this particular routing key
		theSkypeUser    : the Skype user name to send the messages to 


	./topic_listener_skype qpidConfig
	
	For this application, Skype needs to be running on the executing machine.

Make sure when running these executables that you have QPID_INSTALL/lib and CONDOR_RELEASE_DIR/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
Also make sure you have your CONDOR_CONFIG environment variable set and $(CONDOR_BIN) and $(CONDOR_SBIN) in your PATH.


An example session for running pigeon: 
		
		# start the daemon
		condor_pigeon
		
		# run the publisher, where myLog.log is an existing Condor user log file 
		condor_pigeon_topic_publisher myLog.log persist.dat
		
		# run the example listener
		condor_pigeon_topic_listener
