Condor Contrib - PIGEON 

1 - Building:
--------------

Make sure you checked out the entire Condor source tree. Use cmake to build. If you are not using configure_uw , you may need to make cmake aware of your
Qpid install location. 


2 - Running:
-------------

Edit the condor_config_addon file and adapt the paths to what fits your needs. Add this guy to the LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE.

Now you should be good to go and be able to run the daemon
	condor_pigeon

Make sure you have QPID_INSTALL/lib and CONDOR_RELEASE_DIR/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH when doing so. 
Also make sure you have your CONDOR_CONFIG environment variable set and Condor's bin/ and sbin/ in your PATH.


An example session for running pigeon: 
		
		# start the daemon
		condor_pigeon
		
		# run the publisher, where myLog.log is an existing Condor user log file 
		condor_pigeon_topic_publisher myLog.log persist.dat
		
		# run the example listener
		condor_pigeon_topic_listener
