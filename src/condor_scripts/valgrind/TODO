- Come up with some sort of hash for the stack filenames so that it has some hope of being stable between runs. Maybe just hash the stackid_short?

- Ability to note entries to ignore. Perhaps the hash from the previous item?

- prefix filename with error type

- create index page with summary of what is on sub pages.

- Exclude Perl

- Automatically instrument and start up a sharted HTCondor run. Some of the tests rely on a shared HTCondor.  Perhaps start and stop it for each test (ensure isolation), or just run throughout all tests.

- Better handling of SIGTERM (Ctrl+C); kill off children and exit ASAP.

- On exit, aggressively kill off children.

- When anyone (tests or run-tests) starts an HTCondor, they should do it in -f (foreground) mode to simplify cleaning up children. Allowing it to background makes it hard to clean up.

- If the stacks are completely identical, merge across binaries in output. So instead of
  condor_foo
   STACK
  condor_bar
   STACK

  it would be
  condor_foo and condor_bar
    STACK

  Looks like this will catch a lot of cases.
