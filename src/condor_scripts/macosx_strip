# Running strip with no arguments messes up dynamic libraries and
# executables that use non-system dynamic libraries. '-x' is a safe
# strip level for both types of files.
# There doesn't appear to be a way to tell CMake to use arguments with the
# strip command, so we have it run this shell script instead.
#
# '-u -r' will remove more symbols safely for executables.
# If we want to get fancy, we could use file to determine what type of
# file we're stripping and change the arguments to strip accordingly.

exec strip -x "$@"
