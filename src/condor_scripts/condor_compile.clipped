#  On platforms where Condor does not support checkpointing and remote
#  system calls, condor_compile shouldn't be used (since its only role
#  is to relink user jobs with our libraries which provide
#  checkpointing and remote system calls... the libraries that don't
#  exist on these "clipped-wing Condor" platforms).  

cat <<!

This version of Condor does not support checkpointing and remote
system calls on this platform.  You may only submit "vanilla" jobs.
Therefore, you do not need to use condor_compile.  In fact,
condor_compile can't work, since there are no libraries to re-link
your job with.  Please see the Condor Manual for details, which can be
found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual.
