===== Code =====
* Can we do more parse time function evaluation? Perhaps int/real?

* We implement parse time evaluate of abstime differently than run
  time evaluation of abstime. This should be fixed.

* Nick wanted ClassAd:InsertAttrTime()

* Attributes with XML tags in them output correctly?

  [
    '<foo>' = 3;
  ]

* Verify that strings that are all whitespace or zero length can be 
  parsed correctly from XML.

* When calling ParseExpression with "Linux" and there isn't a space at
  the end (the " is the last character) it fails. This can be seen in
  cxi with:
  
  deep_insert adcr.ad arch3 "Linux" 

* Document cxi.

* Test printing values that are classads, lists, or times. 

* There is a memory leak when using the . operator on lists. I fixed
  the memory leak (search for "need_delete" in and attrefs.C and look
  at the EvalState destructor in exprTree.C), but it causes some freed
  memory to be referenced, and I can't figure out why. Until I do, I
  would rather have a leak than to access freed memory. This should be fixed.

* Write some cool XSL to display XML ClassAds.

* Purify, purify, and purify again.

* Test partition views. 

===== Documentation ===== 
* Document how to have relative and absolute times in a classad
  directly. (Use the apostrophe.)

* Document using collections.

* Flesh out all of the doc++ comments to complete the documentation of
  the API. 

* Draw a class diagram to help people figure out the code.

===== test_classads =====
* Individual lexer test functions, to verify proper conversions?

* Figure out what to do for all of the EXCEPTs in the code. 

* Make dependencies for both internal use and for the makefile-dist

* Test that SetViewInfo preserves view name and parent view name.

* Write a separate test_xml?
