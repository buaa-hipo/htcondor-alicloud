Oddities to compiling the C test suite.

GENERAL
-------

stream.c is a condor infrastructure testing program and shouldn't be here.
It should only be compiled with the compiler used to compile condor and
no other.  I removed it from the build process but I left the source here.

HPUX
----
in the 'cc' build directory, edit the generated makefile and at the 
'CC = /usr/bin/cc' line, make it 'CC = /usr/bin/cc -Aa -Ae'.
This will enable the ANSI and EXTENDED options onto the compiler.
It'll get fixed soon.
