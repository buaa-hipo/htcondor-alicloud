There is an assumption of one execute event per lower level
Condor log file. dbtime when issued --thisstep and --nextstep will use these
names and this program to ascertain that previous step worked
and what platform it worked on.

This information is used to rewrite the submit file for the next step so
there is a valid requirements field. The placeholder "PIPELINEBUILD"
must be converted to "Machine == x.y.z.x" for the job to run when the
system is set up this way.

In the other way of running things Ads place job on identical architecture
but the machines can vary. If we can be sure of which host we run on then
we can do redimentatry staging to same host once the process starts.
