The default list of tests is list_quick.

However, its has gotten stale and does not match
the nightly test list as kept in CMakeList.txt.

So I wrote CMakeTestList.pl which takes no arguments
and compiles a new list  Cmake_batch_tests_list.txt.

This was done today, 4/23/13, and copied to list_quick
so we are not testing any tests which are not currently
nightly tests.

We may be doing a few less and I am unsure what
happens on Windows, which pulls another list.
