How to create tests "wrapped" in a personal condor
--------------------------------------------------

Some tests need to start up specific condor components with some
special configuration and then run some checks in that environment.
An example of this sort of test is example_personal_condor_test.run.
A more complicated example of this type of test, involving multiple
personal condors, is job_condorc_abc_van.run.

The basic idea is to start up one or more personal condors using
CondorTest::StartCondorWithParams() and then execute one or more
checks within that environment using check modules in
condor_tests/Check/*.pm.  If any checks fail, then the test is marked
as a failure.

In addition to creating a .run file for your new test, remember to
add it to the Imakefile.  Follow the example of some other working test.
