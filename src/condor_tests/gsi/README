These files represent a partial solution to having a gsi protocol test
which creates it own cert and a Certificate Authority. They need to be integrated
to a new gsi test. NOTE ssl current test creates the files it needs within the 
one file test so everything is clear from looking at the test file itself.

Files targeted already for removal from the test folder imply the new gsi
test is all inclusive for how it lays down the files and certs it needs.
