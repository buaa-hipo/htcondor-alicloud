## CronTab Tests
## We submit a job that is set to run 4 times every 2
## minutes. We keep track of various information about the
## job so that we know the following:
##	1) The jobs are submitted with the proper preptime
##	2) The jobs are only running every 2 minutes
##	3) The NumJobStarts properly reflects how many times we ran
## 	4) The job runs when it was suppose to
##
## When a job finishes but gets rescheduled, we will get
## an eviction notice. If the job ever goes on hold,
## then something went wrong and the test fails
