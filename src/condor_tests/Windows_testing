Install Cygwin

Install Active State perl to c:/perl

Install Windows version of Condor

Install Condor Source Tree

Create a file in your LOCAL_DIR called exe_switch.bat that contains the one line:

  @perl.exe \...\src\condor_scripts\exe_switch.pl %*

In condor_config.local, set:

    USER_JOB_WRAPPER = $(LOCAL_DIR)\exe_switch.bat

Get Condor.pm, CondorTest.pm, CondorPersoanl.pm and batch_test.pl from
		src/condor_scripts into src/condor_tests

Then, try executing one of the tests from a Cygwin window:

	./job_core_output_van.run

And hopefully it works!
