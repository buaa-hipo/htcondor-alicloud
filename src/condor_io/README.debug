D_NETWORK debugging will produce debugging messages for socket LISTEN,
ACCEPT, CONNECT, CLOSE, SEND, and RECV events.  The
LISTEN, ACCEPT, CONNECT, and CLOSE events apply only to TCP
sockets, while the SEND and RECV events apply only to UDP sockets.

Each message has the following format:

  DATE TIME EVENT SELF-IP-PORT [OTHER-IP-PORT]

For example:

1/13 16:56 LISTEN <128.105.73.32:52055>
1/13 16:56 SEND <128.105.73.32:59157> <128.105.175.113:9618>
1/13 16:56 ACCEPT <128.105.73.32:52053> <128.105.73.32:52056>
1/13 16:56 CLOSE <128.105.73.32:52053>
1/13 16:56 ACCEPT <128.105.73.32:52053> <128.105.73.32:52057>
1/13 16:56 CLOSE <128.105.73.32:52053>
1/13 17:01 SEND <128.105.73.32:59171> <128.105.175.113:9618>
