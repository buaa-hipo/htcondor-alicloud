The readtestdata.pl script currently gets all of its data from
the test blog which it scans. It then drops the data suitable
for running through gnuplot.

The condor_readNMIdb.pl program pull information out of the 
NMI database about builds, tests and durations of both also
suitable for plotting.

The make-graphs script is derived from the one alan uses
for condor-users messsage analysis but now handles more
data sets etc.... Still tweaking this for looks.

The various plot data formats are in datafileformats

condor_nmitests.pl is the script which with some DB access
gives information about a particular build and tes run
and allows assigning fault for current issues. When these text
sets are inserted into the blog, we can then make the 
plots which readtestdata.pl creates.

The scripts doanalysis.pl and doautoanalysis.pl tie it
all together.

Ther are run by cron on chopin.

They run from /p/condor/home/tools/build-test-plots.

These scripts all assume that this read only user can access the NMI DB
and that mysql.batlab.org is an available mysql host.

sub DbConnect
{
    $db = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=nmi_history;host=mysql.batlab.org", "nmipublic", "nmi?????????"
	) || die "Could not connect to database: $!\n";
}

NOTE for download logs, the file dologanalysis does all the work
and routes it through make-graphs-hist. With the changes in download plotting 
we are adding custom labels on the x axis to see things like release dates.

The form of these dates is identical to the form in the data files
which are all located in /p/condor/public/html/developers/download_stats.
The event files are here and end in event and start with sendfile.

If one of these events is found during the tally of a week,
the event will be the label for that week.
